Bought mine as a leftover 08. Got a great deal. Idrive, Nav, Cold Weather Pack, Sport Susp, Convert, Sport Seats, Active Steer, and whatever else they can add. Owned 3 weeks, rear quarter window switch went out. Replaced w/o a problem. Dealership is excellent! Gas mileage is a little poor. But I can't keep my foot out of it. This is a great little car for fun. Works well as an everyday driver. This car is amazing. Speed, handling are crazy. Do yourself a favor. Drive one and you will be SOLD. And resale is great.
