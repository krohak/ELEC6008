The Allerton is in a perfect location on the Magnificent Mile, especially if you're in Chicago to see the major sights and/or go shopping. I was afraid to approach the front desk after reading some other reviews, but the staff were perfectly friendly and the concierge very helpful.I was given a king-size room even though I was alone, which was roomy, clean, and nicely decorated. I had no view--just one small window that looked out onto a fire escape--and the room was dark with the lack of sunlight, but in a building that large and old there are going to be some rooms like that, and they might have moved me if I asked. I got the room very cheaply through Hotwire, so I didn't feel comfortable complaining!The hotel restaurant is open only for breakfast and lunch, not dinner (the information book in my room said otherwise). A jazz singer performs in the lounge on Wednesdays and Saturdays, which is nice, and the entire second floor, including the lounge and check-in area, has free Wi-Fi.If you like to channel surf, this is not the hotel for you--there was a nice big TV in my room, but I was surprised to find that it had ONLY pay-per-view programming. And one movie costs $15.00. It seems ridiculous to provide rooms with such nice televisions and not equip them with cable--it would have been nice to at least watch the news. But this was my only major complaint with the place.
