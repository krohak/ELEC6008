Stayed 2 nights in a junior king suite (pictures listed under executive suite on the Allerton website) after finding a great deal online. This room has a bedroom and separate living area, with a t.v in each! I enjoyed having the extra space knowing that the petite and standard rooms are quite small, but this is a boutique style hotel, and that is what you should expect! With that said, I could have not been happier with the hotel and the location of it. The staff was nothing but friendly and helpful. For example, after hours of sightseeing the first day, when we arrived back to the hotel our luggage was still not brought upstairs. When I called down to the front desk they apologized and immediately had someone bring it to us.
