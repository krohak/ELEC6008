The location of this hotel is super, the doorman and the bell boys were very attentive. The only minor is that you have to pay ($ 9,95/24 hrs) for wireless internet connection. It surprised me as we stayed in various hotels/motels during our 4-week trip through 13 states in total (including cities like NYC and Boston) but everywhere the internet was for free. No, correction: at the Motel6 you had to pay $ 2,99/24 hours. But hey, at a nightly rate of $ 60,- what can one expect. For the rest it was fine!
