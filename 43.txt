Chicago: The Allerton Hotel - Chicago. September 17 - 19, 2009 My husband and I were visiting family in Chicago and wanted to spend a couple of days downtown and booked our trip online. The Allerton came up as a four star and because of the location, I thought it would be a good deal. Our experience left a few things to be desired. The hotel is older but the renovations were nice. The valet and bellmen were very accomodating and could not have been more wonderful. We had a pleasant greeting at check-in and that's pretty much where the good times ended. We arrived in our room and the standard room was smaller than hotel rooms I stayed in while visiting New York and I didn't think that was possible.
