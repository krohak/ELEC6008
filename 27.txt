This is the second year in a row we stayed for three nights at the Allerton Hotel; the fact that we came back speaks highly of the property. We really like this place. It's funky, though. When you enter from the street level on Huron (even though it is a Michigan Avenue address), you are greeted by a doorman, but need to take an elevator to the second floor to check in. There really isn't a hotel lobby there either, but there is an understated check-in and concierge desk. The bar and small restaurant are there as well. The elevators are the smallest in North America, but the rooms are sweet and comfortable. This year we reserved the Jr. King Suite for a great price. The room had a living room with a TV and a bedroom with a TV.
