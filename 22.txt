We stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.
