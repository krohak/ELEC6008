My girlfriend and I stayed four days at the Allerton. I couldn't stress enough how great of a location it's in. Everything is in walking distance and a few block away from the metro. We flew into Midway and took the metro all the way into Downtown. We walked a flew blocks and there's the Allerton. It's surrounded by all the famous deep dish pizza joints and all the restaurants you can imagine. It's a few blocks away from the Hancock Building where you can have dinner and drinks on the top floors that have some spectacular views.The rooms were a little small but not that big of a deal. The shower was amazing. Great water pressure and high end soaps to go with it. If you don't plan on hanging out in your room, the petite room is good enough. The fitness center is very modern.
