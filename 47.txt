We took a romantic trip to Chicago for Labor day weekend. The Allerton was in the PERFECT location. We walked almost everywhere in the city. I could not recommend a more wonderfully situated hotel. The decor is splendid, it is art deco and very chic. I loved the lavender smell in the entry and lobby areas. Our room looked over MIchigan Ave. We stayed on the 6th floor. I believe the previous reviewer maybe a little misinformed because this floor was beautifully remodeled and it was only one floor higher than the 5th. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer in their negative rating of service as well. Anytime we requested a service or information it was prompt and the whole staff was very informative. The rooms are small, so I recommend upgrading to a larger room. I believe that their smallest rooms are called &quot;Petite&quot; so try to upgrade from that.
