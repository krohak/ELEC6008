I stayed here via a win on Priceline - good thing i didnt pay full rack rate for this hotel! I had one night that I just wanted to relax after a business trip in Chicago and should have continued my stay at the Affinia around the block!I arrived on a rainy Friday, tired and exhausted from the work week. I was here alone, just wanted to chill and relax and take in the Michigan Avenue sights. The hotel has a very odd entrance. You arrive into the hotel to the bellman's area - - the bellman gladly took my two bags and gave me a ticket/receipt. I figured he would just bring the bags up to my room. NOT. They were SO busy with hundreds of bags in this small area -- and then that particular area leads you to a whole other section of elevator banks -- taking you up to the lobby on the 2nd floor.
