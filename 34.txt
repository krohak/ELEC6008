I stayed in the hotel during a recent business trip to Chicago. While the location is great for sightseeing, it is pretty far away from the airport and there is no shuttle provided by the hotel. The rooms are pretty small but functional. One thing that bothered me was that you couldn't put any of your own stuff in the minibar refrigerator. You will be charged for anything you move and if you didn't consume it, there is a pretty steep 'restocking fee'. Also, the hotel doesn't offer any soda machines so unless you go to the next store a couple of blocks away (which was nicely recommended by the restaurant staff) you are stuck with the overpriced minibar.My main complain came on the day of departure. You have until noon to get out of your room, so I had most of my things packed up but left it in the room until my business meeting as finished. When I returned around 11 am, the room had been cleaned and anything I had not packed away (drinks, cookies, shower stuff) was gone, even though I clearly had not checked out and some of my items were packed in plastic bags.
