I love the car. It handles very well, a little sluggish compared to other car, MB CLK 430A, but is sufficient. I had a little bit of an initial quality problem, HID headlight on right side burned out first day or so. Car was due to go back for dealer add-ons, so no biggy. Was kinda shocked though. Key fob was nightmare for first two weeks. I made the mistake of initializing the car with driver 2's key rather than the #1 key, the car hated that. It would madly and incessantly lock/unlock and beep when I stood next to the car. Reinitialized the car to the driver 1 fob, and it hasn't happened since!
