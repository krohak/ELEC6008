You can't beat the Allerton for location, but even a Motel Six beats it for customer service (or at least the service I received). When I arrived, for a business trip, the distracted and seemingly unhappy desk clerk put me in a terrible room, tucked behind the elevator...tiny...dark...bed went from one wall to the other, so you had to climb across it to cross the room. I called and requested another room. I was put on a different floor in the SAME TYPE of room -- only it smelled dank and unpleasant. It wasn't until I went back down to the desk and demanded a better, sunnier, room that I got one. The desk clerk didn't look too happy, however. That indifference (it even felt like hostility at times) characterized the service during my entire four day stay.
