They tried hard to dress-up this hotel to make it modern but the pretty look doesn't make-up for the quality of the hotel and service. If I hadn't booked on hotwire for a lower price I would have been even more furious with this place.The concierge was the worst one I have had on the magnificant mile. One incident, on Sunday we asked for breakfast spots and the woman conceirge didn't know of any so she asked someone else, who directed us to 1 restaurant that had an hour wait. After 20 minutes of roaming we finally found somewhere else to eat.The elevators were too small and slow to accomodate all floors so we were left taking the dingy smelly staircase. Luckily we were only on the 5th floor. We booked 2 rooms, my sister called ahead of time to make sure she could get a cot in the room for my neice who came at the last minute. They said it would be fine on the phone. When we arrived they said that the cot could not fit in the room we booked and that they had no rooms with double beds. The only option was to upgrade to a King room for $25 and get a rollaway for another $25. My sister decided to squeeze into the King bed with 3 people.Last but not least our rooms were not cleaned well and had a funny smell. The beds were not four star beds, they were so rock hard it felt like we were sleeping on the ground and the were only full size, not even queen. The bathroom and TV were the nicest part of the rooms, but when your in Chicago on vacation you really need a comfortable bed since you spend most of your time walking around.
