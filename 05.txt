This car looked like a terrific value, but it has not turned out that way. I was looking forward to "Honda Reliability" but too many things just don't work well or are gimmicky. Fuel economy is atrocious (14-15), electronics don't work that well, run-flat tires are super loud, there is some wind noise, key fob/keyless entry never works the same twice in a row. Car is pretty slow off the line, but decent on the highway. Ride is too much of a compromise. Handling is good, but the Michelin run-flats are lousy performance tires in all but the correct temperature range. I came out of an Audi A8, and would NOT buy this car again.
