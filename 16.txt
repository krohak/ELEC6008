After having owned the BMW X3, the MDX is a pleasure to drive. Reliability is great for 25,000 miles highway. Only things wrong are Bluetooth; rings and cannot hear whose on the other end and many viable addresses do not show up on Navigation system. Dealer service excellent. A few miss-steps in design; no lights for A/C controls at night; rear view pic doesn't come on in reverse for 10 seconds, some wind noise, transmission can be rough and erratic. No ipod plug which I didn't realize until after I purchased. Front end design could be improved, very masculine. Sounds like a lot but I do really like this car. Also test drive BMW X5 and Lexus 400.
