Stayed here for one night, while in Chicago on business. Front desk was efficient and very pleasant. They upgraded everyone in our group to suites (no prompting required!). The rooms were spacious, with long hallways, separating out three distinct areas: an entrance way, desk/work area and bedroom (and two huge flat screen TVs). Had excellent views of the city, and is in a great location with lots of shopping and dining options just outside your doorway. The hotel bar was also nice, small but cozy. And it looked like they had special happy hour deals, but we missed that. Would definitely recommend this hotel, and am hoping to stay there again the next time I'm in Chicago for work.
