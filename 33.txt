The location is great. However it's difficult to believe it's a 4 stars (the room was not better than some 1 or 2 stars I experimented)...The staff was not friendly. I would not care if they didn't charge us for an expensive room service we didn't order. At first I thought the problem was resolved with the concierge. But finally we saw in our credit card account they still charged us. After email, phone call and fax, we still don't have any answer after 2 weeks...my advice is: be carefull and check your account after your stay.
