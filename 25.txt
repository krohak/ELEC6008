This hotel is located next to the Four Points Hotel and are both part of the Starwood group. For those wanting a downtown location, this property may not be for you - I recommend factoring in taxi fares in and out of town when working out the value here. On the otherside, the rates for the hotel are very good and the rooms are basic but well appointed. TV was more focused on local channels which may be an indication of the clients they are targeting. There was however the standard HBO, BBC, etc. Staff were very friendly and check in and check out times were acceptable.
