Booked the room only a week ahead and was suprised at the rates we were still able to get while other hotels nearby were sold out. Went for my 40th birthday, and if you are going for a special reason make sure to note in the reservation. We were given a couple of free drinks and free breakfast (which we missed!). We also took advantage of the E-upgrade sent to us. Worth it for the bigger room for minimual price increase. Parking did seem to be higher than other places we have stayed in the past, but al least they have valet. Elevators were slow, we were on the 16th floor. Overall we were very happy. Great location. Great staff. Great pricing. We will go back.
