So far I have owned the car for a couple of months and do not regret the purchase at all. I bought it for safety primarily but realized that it also has the legendary Honda quality. The details of this car are incredible, better than the German cars and value wise by 15 K at least also. The car feels like a tank but has the power to go when needed,. This car has near 300hp and you feel every horse! The AWD is incredible, it would take a bulldozer to take it off course.
