Stayed two nights at Aloft on the most recent trip to China. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was spotless and a comfortable king sized bed (as far as soft beds go in China). The staff was very punctual and went out of the way to help my every need, including going to a store across the street to purchase a China Mobile SIM card for me. The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. The 42 LCD screen had movies on demand for 20RMB and had a good selection of western channels including HBO, CNN, BBC, Star World etc The gym was small, had a selection of basic weights and one cable machine, there was however 6 new TechnoGym cardio machines with built in LCD TVs which were very good. The location is a bit out of the way to the central areas of Beijing, but it is better suited for my needs as I need to be in the Haidian district.
