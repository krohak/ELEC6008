I recently stayed at the Allerton and everything about the property exceeded my expectations. The rooms were recently renovated, stylish, clean, and the hotel could not be in a better location. The service was excellent. I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels in Chicago and would put the Allerton at the top with the best properties in town.
