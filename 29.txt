I always do my homework when it comes to booking hotels. After reading a mix of good and bad reviews on this hotel I booked anyway, because I couldnt beat the price. $150 night. And after spending 3nights there I have no complaints! Checking in went smoothly, staff friendly. Room was clean, fresh and suprisingly lots of room! The bathroom was small, but clean. Great location, we always walk everywhere. I would absolutely stay here again!
