Very surprised to read some of the other reviews because our visit was wonderful. The front desk and concierge greeted us and immediately made us feel welcomed. We were able to check in early. Pleasantly surprised by our room (a junior king suite). It was clean, comfortable, quiet. The location could not be beat. The lobby bar and restaurant were very inviting. The old world charm was maintained despite a recent renovation - it was classy and tastefully done. If you're looking for a chain hotel, this is not it but if you're looking for somewhere with character, this is the place. We will definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it to anyone else visiting Chicago.
