The staff was friendly and helpful. When checking in, the front desk manager (Tracy Hunter) selected 3 other rooms for us to look at because the &quot;petite room&quot; wouldn't fit 2 people and our luggage. We got the room through priceline and we've never had a problem with any room until now. Tracy told us there would be an upcharge to change rooms. She also told another group checking in they would be charged more for their room. Other than the experience with Tracy the hotel was nice.
